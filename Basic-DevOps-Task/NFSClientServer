Configuring the Server Machine

Step 1: Install NFS Kernel Server
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server

Step 2: Create the Export Directory
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sharedfolder
sudo chown nobody:nogroup /mnt/sharedfolder
sudo chmod 777 /mnt/sharedfolder

Step 3: Assign server access to client(s) through NFS export file
sudo nano /etc/exports

A single client by adding the following line in the file:
/mnt/sharedfolder clientIP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)

Multiple clients by adding the following lines in the file:
/mnt/sharedfolder client1IP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
/mnt/sharedfolder client2IP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)

Multiple clients, by specifying an entire subnet that the clients belong to:
/mnt/sharedfolder subnetIP/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)

Step 4: Export the shared directory
sudo exportfs -a
sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server

Step 5: Open firewall for the client (s)
sudo ufw allow from [clientIP or clientSubnetIP] to any port nfs
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.100/24 to any port nfs
sudo ufw status

Configuring the Client Machine

Step 1: Install NFS Common
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nfs-common

Step 2: Create a mount point for the NFS hostâ€™s shared folder
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sharedfolder_client

Step 3: Mount the shared directory on the client
sudo mount serverIP:/exportFolder_server /mnt/mountfolder_client
sudo mount 192.168.100.5:/mnt/sharedfolder /mnt/sharedfolder_client

Step 4: Test the connection
Please create or save a file in the export folder of the NFS host server. Now, open the mount folder on the client machine; you should be able to view the same file shared and accessible in this folder.
